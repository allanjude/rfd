# RFD 0005 Unify trace data and metdata

## Problem Statement

The separation of the trace buffer and the metadata (required to interpret it)  is a central design choice
in the implementation of DTrace.
Whilst this decision remains sound, it's implementation is complex requiring clients to invoke 
multiple `ioctl`s to retrieve (and cache) a number of data structures (primarily `dtrace_recdesc_t`
and `dt_pfargv_t`).

Distributing DTrace requires that the trace buffer is processed on a different machine from
which it was captured. Thus, the metadata required to interpret the trace buffer must itself be
serialized, transmitted and deserialized on the machine that is processing the trace buffer.
A prototype implementation has demonstrated the feasibility of serialising (using Cap'n'Proto)
both the  `dtrace_probedata_t` and trace buffer in order to print trace records on another
machine from which they where captured. However, the sheer number of data structures needed to be
serialised makes this a less then straightforward task.

Unifying the metadata within the trace buffer simplifies the `libdtrace` reducing the number of
`ioctls` required to parse the trace. And also simplifies the taks of serialising data for
processing remotely. Thus it is propossed that n first firing a fixed format metdata record
is written into the trace buffer. The metadata record is identified with a reserved metdata id
(for example, #define DTRACE_EPIDMETA 1).
