# RFD 004 UUIDv5 naming of aggregations and enablings

## Problem Statement

Currently, DTrace identifies both aggregations (`dtrace_aggid_t`) and enablings
(`dtrace_epid_`) with simple numerical identifiers (32-bit unsigned integers).
The values of these identifiers depends on the current kernel state.  For
example, aggregation identifiers are assigned by a kernel unit allocator
(`vmem_alloc()` on Illumos and `alloc_unr()` on FreeBSD). The value returned by
the allocator is clearly dependent on the previously allocated/freed values,
which in turn depends on the current DTrace enablings. This is problematic in
a distributed setting as, for example, no guarantess are provided that the same
aggregation computed by different machines will be named consitently.

Similarly to aggregations, DTrace enablings are named by a monotonically
increasing numerical identifier of type `dtrace_epid_t` (an unsigned 32-bit
integer) and as a result the same enabling on a different machine can posses a
completly different identifier. The enablings identifier determine the
semantics of a given trace record. Using different inditifiers where records
posses the same semnatics (and syntax) adds unecessary complexity.

We propose that, as a foundation for distributed tracing, DTrace is extended
to identify aggregations and enablings with a v5 128-bit UUID. As this imposes
a additional 96-bit overhead per trace, using UUID-based indentifies will
be enabled through an additional option to the `dtrace` command line tool.

An aggregation UUID will be created based on a name, formed from concatenating 
a unique namespace, the aggregation's name and the components of its key.
For example, the aggregation `@a[probefunc, arg0]` results in a UUID based on
a hash as follows: `h(namespace|a|probefunc|arg0)`.

Probes will be uniquely idnetified by both the traditional name tuple
`provider:module:function:name` and also by their predication. As with
aggregations, probes will be named in a uniquely specified namespace.
   
## User Visibility

A new option will be added to the `dtrace` command to enable 128-bit UUID-based
naming. 

Aggregation and enabling UUIDs are created within a unique namespace. The
namespace allows identical aggreagtions of enablings to be processed
differently and identifies separate streams of records in the trace buffer;
similarly to the use of the trace UUID in the Common Trace Format [1]. The
user will specify the namespace UUID in the submitted D script.

The trace namespace could be extended in the D langauge as follows:

```
namespace 6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 {

	syscall:::entry {
	}

}
```

or 

```
using namespace 6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8;

syscall:::entry {
}
```

alternaive a textual name could be used for the namespace (which is hashed to derive a UUID):

```
using namespace cadets-trace;

syscall:::entry {
}
```

## Public Interfaces

The proposed changes have no forseen impact on public interfaces.

## Private Interfaces

Various changes to the D compiler will be needed to extend the D language to
become namespace aware. Further investigation is required once the exact
mechanism has been agreed upon.

## Upgrade Impact

The proposed changes have no forseen impact on code or scripts from earlier versions.

## Security Impact

The proposed changes have no forseen security impact.
