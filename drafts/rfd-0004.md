# RFD 004 UUIDv5 naming of aggregations and enablings

## Problem Statement

Currently, DTrace identifies both aggregations (`dtrace_aggid_t`) and enablings
(`dtrace_epid_`) with simple numerical identifiers (32-bit unsigned integers).
The values of these identifiers depends on the current kernel state.  For
example, aggregation identifiers are assigned by a kernel unit allocator
(`vmem_alloc()` on Illumos and `alloc_unr` on FreeBSD). The value returned by
the allocator is clearly dependent on the previously allocated/freed values,
which in turn depends on the current DTrace enablings. This is problematic in
a distributed setting as, for example, no guarantess are provided that the same
aggregation computed by different machines will be named consitently.

Similarly to aggregations, DTrace enablings are named by a motonically
increasing numerical identifier of type `dtrace_epid_t` (an unsigned 32-bit
integer) and as a result the same enabling on a different machine can posses a
completly different identifier. The enablings identifier determine the
semantics of a given trace record. Using different inditifiers where records
posses the same semnatics (and syntax) adds unecessary complexity.

It is propossed that as foundation for distributed tracing, DTrace is extended
to identify aggregations and enablings with a v5 128-bit UUID. As this imposes
a additional 96-bit overhead per trace, using UUID-based indentifies will
be enabled with a additional option to the `dtrace` command line tool.

An aggregations UUID will be created based on a named formed from concatinating a unique namespace, the aggregation's name and the components of its key.
For example, the aggregation `@a[probefunc, arg0]` results in a UUID based on
a hash as follows: `h(namespace|a|probefun|arg0)`.

Probes will be uniquely idnetified by both the traditional name tuple
`provider:module:function:name` and also there predication. As with
aggregations, probes will be named in a uniquely specified namespace.
   
## User Visibility

A new option will be added to the `dtrace` command to enable 128-bit UUID-based
naming. 

Aggregation and enabling UUIDs are creating within a unique namespace. This
namespace allows identicall aggreagtions of enablings to be processes
differently. Idnetifies sperate streams on records in the trace buffer;
similarly to the use of the trace UUID in the Common Trace Format [1]. The
user will specify the namespace UUID in the submitted D script.

The trace namespace could specified be extending the D language as follows:

```namspace 6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 {

	syscall:::entry {
	}

}```

or 

```using namspace 6ba7b814-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8;

syscall:::entry {
}```

or a testualy name could be used, which is hashed to derive aUUID:

```using namspace cadets-trace;

syscall:::entry {
}```

## Public Interfaces

The proposed changes have no forseen impact on public interfaces.

## Private Interfaces

Changes to the compiler will be needed to extanded the D language to become namespace aware. Further investigation is required once the exact mechanism is agreed.

## Upgrade Impact

The proposed changes have no forseen impact on code or scripts from earlier versions.

## Security Impact

The proposed changes have no forseen security impact.
