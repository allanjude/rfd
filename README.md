# Requests for Discussion

Requests for Discussion are an idea promulgated by Joyent and based on
the work with Requests for Comments, originating with the IETF.  The
OpenDTrace project assumes the same model of discussion and
collaboration as to the addition of new features.

See also: [RFC 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3):

Unlike RFCs from the IETF, our RFDs are maintained in Markdown format
which gives us a bit more formal formatting structure and is also a
format that is broadly used in the open source world.

The contents of, and a writing guide for, RFDs is contained
in [RFD 0](./rfd/rfd-0000.md)
